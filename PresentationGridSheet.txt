1. Show how to install Avalonia

2. Create first Avalonia project change the text - show using Content property
   of the window. Set width and height of the window for it to be of normal size
   point out extension - axaml
   Start the app and show the tool
   point the events
         a single Avalonia Routed event can both tunnel and bubble while in
         WPF it is either or. So WPF relies on "Preview" name pattern for
         preview tunneling events that e.g. allow to cancel the main event
         while in Avalonia the same event can have two passes - tunneling
         and bubbling
   Avalonia tool downside - cannot drill down or display bindings
   or call methods

   Show the files. One extra generated file - Program.cs.
   Usually one does not need to touch it

   Usually (like in WPF) one creates a grid or a panel in Avalonia Window
   and adds some elements to it (show).
